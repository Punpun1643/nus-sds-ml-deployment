#### Installing Docker on macOS

1. Prerequisites:
    - macOS must be version `10.14` or newer.

    - Virtualization must be enabled on your system (it usually is by default on modern Macs).

2. Download Docker Desktop for Mac:
    - Go to the official Docker website: [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

    - Navigate to "Get Docker" or "Docker Desktop".

    - Download the Docker Desktop for Mac installer.

3. Install Docker:
    - Locate the downloaded `.dmg` file and double-click to open it.

    - Drag the Docker icon to the Applications folder.

4. Run Docker:
    - Open your Applications folder and click on the Docker app.

    - You'll see a Docker icon in the top status bar indicating that Docker is running.

    - The first time you run Docker, it might ask for privileged access. Grant the necessary permissions.

5. Verify Installation:
    - Open Terminal.

    - Run `docker --version` to check the installed version.

    - Run `docker run hello-world` to ensure Docker can pull and run images.
